	<!-- <h1> Is video surveillance a violation of privacy?</h1>
	<br>
	<p>According to a recent poll 70% of Americans support the use of cameras in public places. In fact, surveillance cameras in public places do not violate human rights instead, they ensure public safety, and prevent crimes. In addition, placing cameras in public places like parking lots and stores should not be considered an invasion of privacy. 
     Firstly, surveillance cameras make public areas exponentially safer because there is a decreased chance of a crime occurring if there is a camera in place, and if a crime does occur you can instantly recognize the criminal. A poll was taken where 78 percent of people said surveillance cameras were a good idea because cameras  put the public at ease; for example, a woman walking alone on an isolated street will find comfort in knowing that there are cameras on that particular street. This comfort and feeling of security will then lead to a more relaxed and happier atmosphere throughout all public areas. For this reason,  banning all cameras ignores the technologies’ plain benefits
    Additionally, cameras are proven to be a very effective tool in helping law enforcement catch perpetrators. In the article “Public Video Surveillance Can Enhance Safety” Richard Gray talks about how without the “presence of video cameras, many perpetrators of both property crimes and violent crimes would not be apprehended and prosecuted” This  is proven by the major role video surveillance has during the most difficult part of an investigation, which is finding evidence on the suspect that removes room for personal opinions and errors. Video surveillance is one of the major ways law officials obtain reliable evidence. For instance, by looking at security footage law enforcement can pinpoint the exact location, time, and direction the suspect was headed towards. This vital information lends a hand in directing the next steps of an investigation and gives investigators a chance to be confident in their investigation. Security cameras also help in determining the accuracy of a witness statement. For example, if a witness goes up to an investigator and describes the suspect’s physical appearance and location, the investigator can look at the security cameras to check whether a person matching the witness’s description was actually in the area of the crime. Cameras are a solution to another challenge faced by law enforcement which is the lack of reliable witnesses. With video surveillance that challenge becomes miniscule because they operate 24/7 and thus record activity no matter what time it is. Even though, there might be some negative aspects to video surveillance like the invasion of privacy there are methods that can be used to fix it. Overall cameras and surveillance are more of a help to society than a violation of human rights.</p>
