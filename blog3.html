			<p> “Never put the key to your happiness in somebody else’s pocket”( kushanwizdom).People often think that your parents should choose your career for you because of the large amount of experience they have, but in all honesty letting them pick your career will lead to lots of pressure placed by them to make you reach their high expectations. You will start detesting your profession and workplace because doing what you hate will only lead to despair, and lastly you will be left feeling like you are playing a role in another person’s life while you are a spectator of your own.By letting your parents pick out your career you let them be the driver of your own life and you end up being the passenger.
                 Research shows that when parents lay pressure on their child  the latter feels less inspired and more threatened . It’s also likely that when the child disappoints the guardian by not meeting their high hopes they will start wondering why they are not good enough.This one thought will then lead to a very low self esteem.
                “The only way to do great work is to love what you do “(Steve Jobs). It is easier to be more accomplished and triumphant when you enjoy the task that you have been given. Disliking your job guarantees an  unsuccesful future. In the 2013 Gallup poll just 30 percent of American employees were passionate and engaged at work , this informs us that 70 percent of the American employees just go to work to earn the money not enjoy the process.There could be multiple reasons  why they feel that way, but the main one being they do not like what they do for a living.
            “Your time is limited so don’t waste it living someone else’s life”(Steve jobs). Sometimes parents can force you to accomplish their ambitions that they could not fulfill; when this happens you have to remember that your dream and their dreams are different and they are not always going to be there to hold your hand  through the strenuous parts of life. To accomplish your goals you need to have the right skills set to be victorious, and it is necessary to realize that you might not have the skills for the job that your parents are propelling you to pursue.
             Many believe that your parents should have a more extensive say in your career than you because they have had more experience. Career Ride says that parents have seen the world better than their children and that is why letting them choose your career  is vital. However it is not their knowledge that brings you prosperity,it is your aspirations and desires.
                       In conclusion, it is important for parents to realize that constraining their child to do a career that they are not interested in will only lead to tremendous amounts of pressure, huge amounts of loathing for that job,and a life that is not their own.</p>
