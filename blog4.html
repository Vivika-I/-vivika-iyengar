			<p> Young adults have to cope with the pressure to "Fit in" on daily basis. Sometimes this pressure can lead to decisions you thought were chosen by you but are actually manipulated and influenced by the people around you. In Ender's Game Orson Scott Card seamlessly showcases how Ender's choices were controlled against him, and because of how young he was, he was easily manipulated. And in the article "The Invisible Influence: How Decisions Are Rarely Ever Our Own" the author discusses the principal issue of knowing when and how our decisions are affected by other people. Ender's game and the article co-relate because of the underlying manipulation throughout both the texts.' 
This informative article illuminates the readers about how their own behavior might not seem like it's been influenced, but everyone's "Likes and dislikes are often driven in subtle, and in surprising ways, by people around us"(Commonlit5). It could be something small like what you decided to eat during lunch or it could be something big like changing your values, morals and beliefs to become like someone else. A common misconception is the fact that influences are always bad, but that isn't always the case. There are a plenty of good influences out in the world and what we choose to heed is up to us. '"We can choose our influences, pick their upsides and avoid their downsides"'(Commonlit 10). 
                    In Ender's Game, influence is key when Val wrote a letter to Ender in battle school to keep him going. It showed how her manipulation played a huge role in the continuation of Ender's education. "...And the despair filled him again. Now he knew why. Now he knew what he hated so much. He had no control over his life. They ran everything. They made all the choices. Only the game was left to him, that was all. Everything else was them and their plans, their lessons, and programs, and all he could do was go this way or that way in battle." (Card 107.) As a young child, he was taken advantage of by not only the people he trusted, but also his own mentors. The aspect of manipulation is also particularly highlighted when Colonel Graff and Major Anderson manipulated Enders social and educational life by influencing big decisions he had to make in their favor. "With Ender, we have to strive a delicate balance. Isolate him enough so he remains creative - otherwise he'll adopt the system here and we'll lose him. At the same time, we need to make sure he keeps a strong ability to lead." (Card 20)  
In conclusion the decisions we make are always influenced by the people around us we just rarely see the effect of it on ourselves. Everyone is susceptible to influence and manipulation whether it's good or bad. Young people tend to be a little more susceptible to bad influences because they want to fit in with a group of people who do certain things. They also haven't fully matured yet and are quite gullible individuals that depend on others to pave them a path that they can follow. </p>
